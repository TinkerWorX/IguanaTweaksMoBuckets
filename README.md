# Mo' Buckets
An extension to Iguana Tweaks for Tinkers Construct which add support for more fluids in clay buckets. Currently the following mods are supported.

* MineFactory Reloaded
* BuildCraft|Energy
* Ex Nihilo

You're free to use the mod however you want, but sending a message if you do would be nice.

If you need support for more fluids, feel free to create an issue, and I'll make it as soon as possible, or make it yourself with a Pull Request.
